- ***void()*** `sleep(int sec=1,int msec=0,int mcrsec=0,int nsec=0)`: sleep for a certain amount of time. throws -1 on failure
- ***class TimeTracker***: basically a stopwatch, with start and stop only
  - ***std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point*** `startTime`: time start() was called
  - ***std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point*** `endTime`: time end() was called
  - ***duration\<double, std::milli\>*** `timeTime`: time between start and end, calculated when end() is called
  - ***bool*** `ended`: if ended yet
  - ***void()*** `start()`: sets startTime and makes ended false
  - ***void()*** `end()`: sets endTime and makes ended true
  - ***double()*** `time()`: returns the time between startTime and endTime as double if ended is true. returns -1 otherwise.
