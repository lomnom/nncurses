- ***void()*** `sleep(int sec=1,int msec=0,int mcrsec=0,int nsec=0)`: sleep for a certain amount of time. throws -1 on failure
- ***class TimeTracker***: basically a stopwatch, with start and stop only
  - ***std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point*** `startTime`: time start() was called
  - ***std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point*** `endTime`: time end() was called
  - ***duration\<double, std::milli\>*** `timeTime`: time between start and end, calculated when end() is called
  - ***bool*** `ended`: if ended yet
  - ***void()*** `start()`: sets startTime and makes ended false
  - ***void()*** `end()`: sets endTime and makes ended true
  - ***double()*** `time()`: returns the timeTime as double if ended is true. returns -1 otherwise.
  - [example](../examples/spamgame)
- ***class TimeLimiter***: Limits time accurately, accounting for time taken by computations.
  - ***long double*** `time`: mimnimum amount of time that should pass between `start()` and `end();delay();`
  - ***TimeTracker*** `tracker`: internal time tracker used for start() and end()
  - ***void()*** `start()`: starts time frame
  - ***void()*** `end()`: ends time frame
  - ***void()*** `delay()`: delays `time`-`tracker.time()` time
